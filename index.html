        <h1>Hello from my Web Application!</h1>
        <p>This is a simple web page developed with Flask, HTML, and CSS.</p>
        <p>Web app development is the process of creating application software 
        that runs on a web browser and is accessed through the internet.
        It involves building both the front-end (what users see and interact with) using
        technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the back-end
        (server-side logic and databases) using languages
        like Python, PHP, or Node.js. Web apps are popular because they donâ€™t 
        require installation, can be accessed from any device, and are easy to update.
        This makes them ideal for businesses and services that want to reach users 
        across multiple platforms efficiently.</p>
